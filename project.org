   Appearently was just a typo.

*** DONE Fix too high initial potential
    CLOSED: [2018-03-19 Mon 22:26]
    Still unsure if it's a reasonable initial potential, but looks better at least.
    Permittivity still an open question.
** NEXT Fix time stepping
   Think through, if we can work all through the simulation with the normalized concentration.
 Things to try:
 - QR Decomposition
 - LU Decomposition with SciPy
** TODO Is this a reasonable initial potential?
** TODO Add README
** TODO Add a formula for the activity coefficient
** TODO Find missing constants/values
** TODO Add licence
* Ideas
** Range checks
** Add stress part of model
